## Key Dependencies

### Frontend 

DaedalusData's frontend relies on several key open-source libraries:

- **Nuxt**: Framework for building Vue.js applications
- **Three.js**: JavaScript 3D library for visualizations
- **D3.js**: JavaScript library for data visualization
- **Pinia**: State management for Vue.js
- **UnoCSS**: Instant on-demand atomic CSS engine
- **VueUse**: Collection of Vue composition utilities

### Backend

The Python backend leverages these key libraries:

- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for scientific computing
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation library
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Machine learning frameworks
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **UMAP-learn**: Dimensionality reduction library
